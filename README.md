POC for pulling some text out of HTML with Python

A coworker found a site that randomly displayed developer excuses (http://www.programmerexcuses.com/), but mentioned that it did not have an API.

I wrote this as a quick proof-of-concept for pulling the text out without the need for an API. I'm storing this here so I can remind myself of the process later ;)
